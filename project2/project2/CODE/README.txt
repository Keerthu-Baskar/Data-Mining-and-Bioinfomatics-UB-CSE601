KMeans

1) Place all the files in the same folder(input and code)
2) Run the code using "python3 kmeans.py" command
3)After entering the required inputs, the results are visualized
4)Once you close the plot, The jaccard coefficient and rand index values are printed

DBSCAN IMPLEMENTATION:
1)Place the datasets iyer.txt, cho.txt and the dbscan.py file in the same directory.
2)Run the python file using the command python dbscan.py
3)Prompts you to enter the filename with extension, the eps value and the minimum points.
4)After entering the required inputs, the results are visualized
5)Once you close the plot, The jaccard coefficient and rand index values are printed

HIERARCHIAL
1)Place the datasets iyer.txt, cho.txt and the hac.py file in the same directory.
2)Run the python file using the command python hac.py
3)Prompts you to enter the filename with extension, and the number of clusters.
4)After entering the required inputs, the results are visualized and the plots are displayed where you can identify the clusters
5)Once you close the plot, The jaccard coefficient and rand index values are printed

GMM

1) Place all the files in the same folder(input and code)
2) Run the code using "python3 gmm.py" command
3) Enter the filename , number of clusters and iterations
4)After entering the required inputs, the results are visualized and the plots are displayed where you can identify the clusters
5)Once you close the plot, The jaccard coefficient and rand index values are printed

Spectral Clustering
