# UB CSE 601 - DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS

# Project 1

This project contains 2 parts. In the first part, I implemented PCA (Principle Components Analysis) algorithm, project the high-dimensional data to 2 dimensions, and plot the 2-dimensional data points. In the second part, I implemented Apriori and association rule generation algorithms. Biomedical data consisting of disease names is used for this project

# Project 2

Implement five clustering algorithms to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression profiles: K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering with Min approach, density-based, mixture model, and spectral clustering. Compare these five methods and discuss their pros and cons.
For each of the above tasks, we are required to validate our clustering results using the following methods:
• Using external index (Rand Index and Jaccard Coefficient) and compare the clustering results from different clustering algorithms. The ground truth clusters are provided in the datasets.
• Visualize data sets and clustering results by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

# Project 3

Implement three classification algorithms: Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and Naïve Bayes.
• Implement Random Forests based on your own implementation of Decision Tree.
• Adopt 10-fold Cross Validation to evaluate the performance of all methods on the provided two datasets in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-1 measure.
• For Kaggle competition, Apply various tricks on the Kaggle dataset provided on top of any classification algorithm discussed in class (including nearest neighbor, decision tree, Naïve Bayes, SVM, logistic regression, bagging, AdaBoost, random forests) and tune parameters using training data.
