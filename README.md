# UB CSE 601 - DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS

# Project 1

This project contains 2 parts. In the first part, I implemented PCA (Principle Components Analysis) algorithm, project the high-dimensional data to 2 dimensions, and plot the 2-dimensional data points. In the second part, I implemented Apriori and association rule generation algorithms. Biomedical data consisting of disease names is used for this project
